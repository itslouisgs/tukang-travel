# TukangTravel
This is the landing page of **TukangTravel**—a lifestyle app designed for travelers looking for adventure and hidden gems—built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

[Visit the website here](https://tukang-travel.web.app/)

## Overview
This app is a solution for travelers looking for adventure and hidden games across Indonesia. However, it is actually not if it doesn’t have a landing page that promotes and attracts users.

As the web developer on my team, I was assigned to building the landing page.

This idea was initiated by [Steven](https://github.com/stevenwj12), Vincent, and me.
